# Sort-Numbers-AssemLang
Assembly language program to sort five numbers in ascending order

Sample Run: (Zero indicates end of array)
Set1: 1,4,6,0
Set2: 1,3,5,8,0
Union: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0
3- Write a program that finds intersection of two sets (ordered integer arrays). Assume there will
be at max 10 elements in union.
Sample Run: (Zero indicates end of array)
Set1: 1,4,6,0
Set2: 1,3,6,8,0
Intersection: 1, 6, 0
4- Write a program that finds staring index of a subset from a set (smaller array from a larger
array).
Sample Run:
Set:1,2,4,1,1,2,3,1,2,5
Subset: 1,2,3
Index: 4 (After program. -1 if subset not found.)
5- Write a program that reverses an array of 6 numbers using BX+SI and BX+DI addressing. Sample
run is given below.
Sample Run:
Input Array1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Array1 after program execution: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
